# Installation

Open Blender's Preferences from the Edit menu and select the Add-ons pane.

Click Install and navigate to the location of the downloaded zip file, which should be named something like
in_betweens.zip

Select the zip file, click Install Add-on to install the addon and then activate it by checking the checkbox
next to it in the list of addons.

That's it, you're good to go!
